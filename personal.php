<h2>Personal Stuff</h2>
<p>The vast majority of my time is spent hacking&mdash;it's truly what I love
   to do. I've been going at it for about 10 years now. With that said,
   this page contains stuff about me <em>unrelated</em> to programming.</p>

<p>I enjoy most mainstream American sports; particularly football. I'm a big
   Patriots fan and eagerly await another Super Bowl in the Brady/Belichick
   era.</p>

<p>I enjoy cigar smoking, cheeseburgers, beer drinking and debating people on 
   the Internet (sometimes all at once).</p>

<p>I currently live with my girlfriend, Kaitlyn Brady, in Westborough, MA.</p>

<p>If you wish to contact me for any reason whatsoever, you may email me:

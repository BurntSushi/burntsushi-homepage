<h2>X11</h2>

<p><?=aurl('Programs I\'ve developed using X.', 'x11/apps.php')?></p>

<p>For the last couple of years, I have been mildly obsessed with X11. I'm not
   exactly sure why, but I suspect it's because working with X is like trying
   to put together a giant puzzle. I'm still finding pieces hidden beneathe
   the couch, and I can <em>almost</em> make out the picture the puzzle is
   trying to portray.</p>

<p>On this page, I'm going to try to sum up some of what I've learned about
   X over the years in hopes that it will save others countless sleepless
   nights.</p>

<p>I need to find time to write something here.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the 
   <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu">Computer Science department at Tufts University</a>.
   My advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~cowen/">Lenore Cowen</a>.
   In general, my <?=aurl('research interests', 'research.php');?> are focused 
   on computational biology. I am still searching for a narrower focus, but
   I have recently worked on projects involving genetic interaction networks,
   protein fragment libraries and remote homology detection.</p>

<p>I am a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)">programmer</a>.
   My current weapons of choice are Python, Go
   and <a href="http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20070219/044101.html">Haskell</a>.
   I have worked on many different kinds of projects, from
   web applications to X11 window managers. More recently, building an
   <?=aurl('X11 window manager', 'x11');?> with good multi-head, tiling and
   floating support has been an obsession.</p>
